      <p>HTML (the Hypertext Markup Language) and CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) are two of the core technologies for
        building Web pages.
        HTML provides the structure of the page, CSS the (visual and aural) layout, for a variety of devices.
        Along with graphics and scripting, HTML and CSS are the basis of building Web pages and Web Applications.
        XHTML is a variant of HTML that uses the syntax of XML, the Extensible Markup Language.
        XHTML has all the same elements (for paragraphs, etc.)as the HTML variant, but the syntax is slightly different.
        Because XHTML is an XML application, you can use other XML tools with it (such as XSLT, a language for

        CSS is the language for describing the presentation of Web pages, including colors, layout, and fonts.
        It allows one to adapt the presentation to different types of devices, such as large screens, small screens, or
        printers.
        CSS is independent of HTML and can be used with any XML-based markup language.
        The separation of HTML from CSS makes it easier to maintain sites, share style sheets across pages, and tailor
        pages to different environments.
        This is referred to as the separation of structure (or: content) from presentation.
